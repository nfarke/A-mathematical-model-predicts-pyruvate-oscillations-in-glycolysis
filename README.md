These files contain the code to build and analyse the model.

The analysis was performed for an upshift and downshift of the glucose uptake rate.

main.m: produces ensembles of models with n=5000 different parameter sets for eight
models that differ in their regulatory feedback structure. For each model,the number
of parameter sets that produce oscillations are counted.

Results.mat corresponds to the "complete" model with three allosteric feedback regulations.
